## Code Cleanup

This option will be a config option on the server side before rendering with Fastify for a performance focus. Meta elements will have an additonal attribute indicating if they should be moved. This is to ensure a SEO source can be served by config or a source focused on pure censorship evasion.

- Fixed AD config setting being opt-out; ads are not implemented in the project however
- Added Rammerhead support (locally)
- Drastically updated visuals across the service and refactored stylesheets
- Bumped games page functionality
- Updated randomization scripts to ES6 syntax and implemented the alternative to RegEx string replacement
- Helmet for express implemented into backend
- Improved component handling via templates.mjs along with deletion of obsolete files that previously handled this standard in a poor format

- Greatly optimized client-side scripts across the site with a new standard, and generally reworked to no longer leave global variables
- Changes to server.mjs with path logic and error handling
- Updated standards for common scripts
- libcurl and bare-as-module support added
- Deleted 5 JS scripts and moved lots of data into JSON files. Big reorganization. Games menu core scripts now nested inside of common.js utilizing a JSON system
