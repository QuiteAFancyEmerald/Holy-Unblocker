<h1>How to find the Icon URL of a Site</h1>

<p>Bascially go to the website you need an icon for then do Ctrl+U to view the source code. Near the top you will need to look for something that looks like "<link rel="icon" href="http://example.com/favicon.png">". It can be in many forms. (.ico also works) </p>
<p>Copy the URL inside the parenthesis of href="". Then go back to HB and enter in the URL for the Icon URL in Settings. Enjoy. </p>
